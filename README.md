# Bits and Pieces

This repository holds code snippets, dotfiles, scripts and other stuff that I use at work and in private.

# iTerm2

The iTerm2 dynamic profiles feature is used to automatically load profiles to iTerm2.
After installing _bits'n'pieces_, please make sure to select the iterm profile and make it default.

To do that, open `iTerm2 -> Preferences -> Profiles` (or, `âŒ˜ + ;`), select the _iterm_ profile, click `Other Actions...`, and finally _Set as Default_.
